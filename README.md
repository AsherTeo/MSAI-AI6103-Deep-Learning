# MSAI-AI6103-Deep-Learning

In the first assignment, we are required to train a classifier using Resnet-18 to predict the classes in Cifar-10 datasets. After that, we improved the prediction accuracy by finetuning the hyper-parameters. The hyper-parameters consists of different learning rate, different learning rate schedule, different weight decay values and data augmentation.
