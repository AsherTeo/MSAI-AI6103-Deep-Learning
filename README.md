# MSAI-AI6103-Deep-Learning

In the first assignment, we are required to train a classifier using Resnet-18 to predict the classes in Cifar-10 datasets. After that, we improved the prediction accuracy by finetuning the hyper-parameters. The hyper-parameters consists of different learning rate, different learning rate schedule, different weight decay values and data augmentation. 

For the Project, my task was to research and experiment 4 to 5 different Regularization methods using Resnet-The four methods that I will be using are mainly Stable Weight Decay, Jacobian Regularization, CutMix Augmentation and Drop Block.
